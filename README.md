# Welcome to AQWA!

Hey there! Welcome to the **Air Quality and Weather Application (AQWA)**.

This application offers two basic functionalities on Climate. 

1. **Air Quality**:  You can get the air quality, pollutant details and recommended course of actions under 5 different categories for a specific location.
2. **Weather** : You can get the current weather conditions and forecast for the next three days for any location.

## How To Use

No installation. No set up!

Simply extract the **AQWA.zip** file and launch the `index.html` file under *master* directory in your favorite browser. That's it!

### Important Note:

You have to subscribe to the APIs used in the Application and get your own API keys. Once you get the API keys, simply update them in the `settings.js` file under *js/dist/climate-app/config* path.
